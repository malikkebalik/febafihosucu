During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he described a gymnast's pre-Olympics injury as "like having a tear in your wedding dress right before you walk down the aisle." His commentary has resulted in some in the gymnastics community criticizing Trautwig long before the Biles controversy at the 2016 Rio Olympics, mainly by die-hard fans of the sport who feel that Trautwig serves only to perpetuate the stereotypes of women's gymnastics.</p><p>In addition to his current duties, at the beginning of the 2006 football season Trautwig became a radio host as well, hosting the radio version of NBC's Football Night in America for Westwood One, which co-produces the show (called NBC NFL Sunday) with the network. However, Trautwig left the show in the middle of the season.</p><p>From 2005–2008, he also co-anchored USA Network's coverage of the US Open tennis tournament. Trautwig also had a cameo in the movie Cool Runnings as an announcer for the bobsled competition. He now co-anchors the US Open's live feed during the tournament.</p><p>He has co-anchored coverage of the Tour de France (from 2004 to 2007 on Versus (formerly OLN) and in the 1980s for ABC), the Olympics, and NBC's coverage of the Arena Football League. Despite his years of experience as a broadcaster, he was sometimes criticized by cycling fans, for his occasionally uninformed commentary, and his tendency to compare the Tour to various mainstream sports he covers.</p><p>The 2000 New York Sportscaster of the Year, Trautwig has covered the last eight Olympic games, and has won New York Sports Emmys for his coverage of the Yankees, Knicks, and Rangers. From 1991–2001, Al was host of the New York Yankees' pre- and post-game shows on MSG Network, and also was in the booth for a few innings per game. In 2006, he hosted the new MSG show called Al Trautwig's MSG Vault, which featured vintage and sometimes discovered lost footage of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.</p><p>Since 2000, Trautwig has taken over the spot long covered by <a href=#>John Tesh</a> of hosting U.S. national and international gymnastics competitions, including the 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic games. Trautwig's co-hosts include former Olympic gold medalist <a href=#>Tim Daggett</a>, former Canadian champion gymnast <a href=#>Elfi Schlegel</a>, three-time Olympian <a href=#>John Roethlisberger</a> and 2008 Olympic champion Nastia Liukin.</p><p>Trautwig was one of the original hosts for Classic Sports Network when it was founded in 1996.</p><p>He was a television pit reporter alongside <a href=#>Jim McKay</a> for ABC Sports' coverage of the 1986-1987 Indianapolis 500.</p><p>In the 1980s, Trautwig hosted USA Network's coverage of the National Hockey League; one off-beat feature that he did was to interview a water fountain. He also occasionally would do the sponsor plugs for WWF shows that would air on the USA Network in the mid-'80s. He occasionally guest hosts the NHL on Versus studio program Hockey Central. He also anchored several MISL games from 1978 to 1992.</p><p>Alan Trautwig (born February 26, 1956) is a sports commentator with the MSG Network, ABC, NBC, NBC Sports Network, and USA Network. He does the pre-game and post-game shows for the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, as well as fill-in play-by-play for both teams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVflrluwNGarK2vmZw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amani-toomer-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amani Toomer Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
