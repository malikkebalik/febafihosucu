Though his career was at an all-time high, Ledger, unfortunately, didn’t reap the benefits of his success for very long as he tragically died from a drug overdose in 2008.</p><p id=par-2_20>At the time of his death, Ledger was worth millions of dollars. But who ended up inheriting his large fortune?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Heath-Ledger-1.jpg><h2 id=h-heath-ledger-s-career>Heath Ledger’s career</h2><p id=par-3_37>Ledger made his acting debut in 1992, taking on a small role in the family film Clowning Around. After that, he appeared in three episodes of the Australian television series Ship to Shore from 1993 to 1994.</p><p id=par-4_34>In 1996, Ledger landed a recurring role in the television series Sweat, in which he played the character, Snowy Bowles. But it wasn’t until 1999 that Ledger got his first taste of Hollywood stardom.</p><p id=par-5_18>That year, he starred in the teen comedy 10 Things I Hate About You alongside actor Julia Stiles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Heath-Ledger-and-Julia-Stiles.jpg><p id=par-6_22>Ledger then went on to star as supporting characters in hit blockbuster films such as The Patriot (2000) and Monster’s Ball (2001).</p><p id=par-7_26>He eventually landed lead roles in films such as A Knight’s Tale (2001), The Four Feathers (2002), The Order (2003), Ned Kelly (2003), and Casanova (2005).</p><p id=par-8_17>Ledger later received critical acclaim for his appearances in Brokeback Mountain (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008).</p><h2 id=h-heath-ledger-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death>Heath Ledger’s net worth at the time of his death</h2><p id=par-9_31>On January 22, 2008, Ledger died at the age of 28 inside his New York City apartment. Autopsy reports concluded that the actor had died of an accidental prescription drug overdose.</p><p id=par-10_14>At the time of his death, Ledger had a net worth of $16.3 million.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_32>Following his death, people began speculating reasons why he overdosed. Some suggested that the actor’s fragile state of mind after playing The Joker in The Dark Knight contributed to his untimely death.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_13>However, his sister Kate Ledger later insisted that those rumors were completely untrue.</p><p id=par-13_41>“Honestly it was the absolute opposite.
