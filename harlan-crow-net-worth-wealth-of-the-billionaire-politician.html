His company, Crow Holdings, worth $29 billion, invests in real estate and private equity.</p><p>Let’s get to know him first. Harlan Crow is the unsung hero of… well, nobody knows. He’s like a modern-day Renaissance man.</p><p>He’s active in conservative political circles and supports cultural and educational projects. Crow has donated significantly to institutions like the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s also notable for his collection of historical items and artwork. Beyond business, he’s engaged with think tanks and policy groups, further influencing public discussions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=source-of-income></span>Source of Income<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Crow, the son of Trammell Crow, who was once a prominent landlord in the U.S., shares that when he assumed control of the company in 1988, it was in a dire financial state.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thrillng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Harlan-at-his-Highland-Park.jpg><p>He recalls their economic value had significantly declined, perhaps even nearing bankruptcy. Over about five years, he worked extensively to stabilize the situation, and then they underwent negotiations and worked through challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Crow emphasizes their commitment to maintaining high integrity throughout the process. Looking back, he believes they managed the situation ethically and honorably, leading to a successful outcome.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Harlan Crow’s net worth is around $3 billion</strong>. He owns a super expensive $55 million mansion in Dallas, the costliest ever built in the city. He runs Crow Holdings, a big company worth $29 billion that invests in real estate and private equity.</p><p>Crow Holdings is a private investment company focusing on real estate, private equity, and other investment opportunities. They own things like hotels, malls, and office buildings.</p><p>Harlan Crow’s growing wealth by 2024 shows he’s good at business and investing. Some people like his political views, but others criticize his significant donations.</p><p>He’ll likely be remembered as a real estate developer and investor for a long time. His money and influence will keep him essential in American business and culture.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth-growth></span>Net Worth Growth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harlan Crow is the head of Crow Holdings, a private investment company focusing on real estate.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s also a board member for companies like The St. Paul Travelers Corporation in Dallas. His wealth is almost $3.1 billion. The corporation owns things like office buildings, shopping centers, and hotels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thrillng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Harlan-Crow-sits-for-Photograph.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=power-game></span>Power Game<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harlan Crow is a clever investor, strategically contributing to influential figures as an investment. His company owns over 500 properties across the U.S. Government approvals, which usually take two weeks, are expedited to just 24 hours for Crow.</p><p>By leveraging political connections, Crow successfully bid on more than 100 properties with no other bidders in auctions. Politicians also aid Crow by sharing the highest bid, allowing him to outbid with precision.</p><p>Thanks to his ties in government, Crow has acquired numerous properties in Washington D.C., often at half their market value. These actions showcase his ability to capitalize on his political relationships for advantageous real estate deals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thrillng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Harlan-Crow-in-an-interview-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=mansion></span>Mansion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite agreeing to showcase their Highland Park home and grounds on the Park Cities Historical and Preservation Society tour, Harlan prefers discussing the impressive library over what some might find more captivating: the sculpture garden.&nbsp;</p><p>The library, an addition to the 1917 house, is striking with its floor-to-ceiling bookshelves holding rare titles. The visitor is surrounded by two levels of dark, gleaming cabinetry filled with books.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thrillng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Harlan-Crow-inside-a-private-library.jpg><p>The library and public spaces of the family residence are adorned with luxurious rugs. Harlan Crow highlights the library’s magnificence rather than the renowned sculpture garden.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=luxurious-cars></span>Luxurious Cars<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harlan Crow’s cars need a garage, as they are 77 in number! His fleet of luxurious cars is a jaw-dropping parade of vehicular wonders that make everyday supercars look like child’s play.</p><p>They fear the estate might become a local attraction, hosting events like school tours, weddings, and group visits to Crow’s private library and sculpture garden. Some worry that Crow might seek rezoning to convert his property into a museum.</p><p>Crow, the CEO of Crow Holdings, said he won’t pursue rezoning. He explained that the garage mainly serves guests visiting his library for research, parties, and fundraisers, preventing them from parking on nearby streets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related Stories:</strong> <a href=#>Shailene Woodley Net Worth 2023</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=assets></span>Assets<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harlan Crow, 75, is the head and previous CEO of Crow Holdings, a company dealing with real estate investment and development.&nbsp;</p><p>His firm, which holds assets worth $29 billion, owns properties across Texas, Washington State, and California.</p><p>The company owns different real estate types, focusing mainly on student dorms and tall apartment buildings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=donations></span>Donations<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Crow strongly backs the Republican party and has given significant donations since Ronald Reagan’s time.

Bush campaigned.&nbsp;</p><p>He has been generous to George Bush, McCain, and Donald Trump.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harlan Rogers Crow, an American real estate entrepreneur born in 1949 in Dallas, Texas, is currently the chairman of Crow Holdings, a company established by his father, Trammell Crow.&nbsp;</p><p>He is known for actively supporting conservative and Republican causes.
