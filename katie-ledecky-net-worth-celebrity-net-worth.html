Katie is considered by many to be the best female swimmer of all time.</p><h2 id=endorsement-money><strong>Endorsement Money</strong></h2><p>When Katie was still an NCAA student athlete, she could not accept endorsement income or prize money from a professional competition. She actually turned down what could have been as much as <a href=#>$5 million in earnings ahead of the 2016 Olympics</a> so she could remain a Stanford athlete.</p><p>However, in May 2018, she turned pro and signed her first major endorsement deal with swimwear company TYR. The deal paid Ledecky $7 million over six years.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Katie Ledecky was born Kathleen Genevieve Ledecky on March 17, 1997, in Washington, D.C.
