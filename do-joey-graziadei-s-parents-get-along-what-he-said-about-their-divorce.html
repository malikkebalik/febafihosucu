Where they stand post-divorce</h2><p id=par-3_50><a href=#>The Bachelor Season 28 finale</a> features Joey Graziadei’s parents and siblings. Fans who watched Charity Lawson’s season of The Bachelorette likely remember that Joey’s parents are divorced.

He explained that he discussed talking about his dad coming out with his dad before heading on TV. “I wanted to make sure he was OK with me sharing his story because it’s something that’s affected me, but it’s really his life. … He was comfortable, and he trusted me on how I would, at least, carry myself and talk about it, that it would be done in the right light.”</p><p id=par-5_33>So, do Joey’s parents get along despite their divorce? According to Joey, they remained civil. He calls them “amazing co-parents” and told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a> that The Bachelor has brought the whole family closer.</p><p id=par-6_42>“They’ve been so supportive. I’m so lucky to have my family through this,” Joey said. “I think that one of the most beautiful things about this show is [how] it’s brought my family closer together. They just have been in my corner.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daisy-kent-and-kelsey-anderson-meet-his-family-during-the-bachelor-season-28-finale>Daisy Kent and Kelsey Anderson meet his family during ‘The Bachelor’ Season 28 finale</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_35>The Bachelor Season 28 finale shows Daisy Kent and Kelsey Anderson meeting Joey Graziadei’s parents and siblings.

Daisy told the cameras that she worried his family wouldn’t be able to “see” her for who she was. “I really need today to go well,” she said.</p><p id=par-9_57>Daisy then told Joey’s family about her past illness and cochlear implant. She then teared up while talking about her experience on the show. “Honestly, this whole experience, it has changed my life,” she said. “And that’s because of him and who he is. And I know that’s a lot because of the people who love him.”</p><p id=par-10_18>Kelsey also teared up while visiting Joey’s family. She talked about her mother, whom she’s still grieving.</p><p id=par-11_18>“I know that she would love Joey,” Kelsey said of her mother. “He’s got, like, the best heart.”</p><p id=par-12_22>Joey’s mother remarked on the difficult decision that Joey was going to have, as he had two amazing women to choose from.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joey-graziadei-said-his-family-enjoys-being-on-camera>Joey Graziadei said his family enjoys being on camera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Bachelor-Season-28-Joey-Graziadei-Jesse-Palmer.jpg><p id=par-13_19>Joey Graziadei talked to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicks in the Office podcast</a> about his family reappearing in The Bachelor Season 28.</p><p id=par-14_70>“They’re veterans now,” Joey said of his family. “They’re used to this now. We did the hometown package before, and I’m like, ‘Why do you guys, like, you’re liking this.’ And then by the end, when we do the hometowns when people come, and my family comes, they’re like veterans. I’m like, ‘OK, you guys got this.’ They’ve been nothing but supportive. I’m lucky to have such a loving family.”</p><p id=par-15_62>Joey noted that his family had concerns over him becoming the lead. But they trusted in his ability to navigate the process. “They’re worried about how much the lead gets scrutinized and is under a microscope, and they just want to make sure that they’re feeling good,” he said. “… They have faith in me, and that’s all I can ask for.”</p><p id=par-16_16>The Bachelor&nbsp;Season 28 finale airs on Monday, March 25, 2024, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p id=par-17_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm5icoJWhvLN50p6YrKeeYn95ecmonLJll6euu7XAnZyiq12lrrOxza2qZp%2BVqXqiuM6nnmarkZ6xbrDIr6arm5VjtbW5y2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joseph-c-phillips-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joseph C.
