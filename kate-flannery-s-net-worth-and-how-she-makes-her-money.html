Flannery was on&nbsp;The Office for a very long time, though fans might have seen her around on <a href=#>other TV shows</a> as well. It seems that Flannery has managed to have an interesting comedy career, so let’s take a look below to find out what her net worth is.</p><h2>Kate Flannery started her career in improv</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kate-Flannery.jpg><p id=par-2_26>Flannery was born on June 10, 1964, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She attended Shenandoah University in Virginia as well as the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.</p><p id=par-3_33>In the early ’90s, Flannery became a part of The Second City, one of the most famous improvisational theaters in Chicago. Later on, she became one of the original members of&nbsp;Chicago’s Annoyance Theater.</p><p id=par-4_65>At the Annoyance Theater, Flannery performed in a feminist comedy show called “The Miss Vagina Pageant,” which caught the eye of a producer from&nbsp;<a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>. Flattery later <a href=#>recalled</a>: “Four of the six of us [in the play] were under consideration for SNL … I just remember it began to feel like a real pageant because we were vying for the next spot [on SNL].”</p><p id=par-5_24>Flannery ended up appearing on&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;for one episode in 2002. However, the highlight of her career would actually take place on another NBC hit show.</p><h2>Kate Flannery was on ‘The Office’ for nine seasons</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_39>The Office premiered in 2005 and quickly became extremely popular with viewers. In the first season, Flannery only had a recurring role as Meredith Palmer on the show. Yet, from Season 2 onward, she became a main cast member.</p><p id=par-7_29>The Office stayed on the air for nine seasons until its end in 2013. The series allowed Flannery to showcase her comedy talent to countless people around the world.</p><p id=par-8_87>Looking back, Flannery has a lot of positive emotions with the show even if it had to end. She once said in an <a href=#>interview</a>: “I am so proud of the ending of The Office. I felt that everything was wrapped up so nicely. It was sad and funny and thoughtful and everything you want in a finale… I am so sad, but I am so proud. It’s a great feeling to be a part of such a respected and honored project. A very rare thing in life.”</p><p id=par-9_86>In an essay for <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>, Flannery also expressed her gratefulness for&nbsp;The Office. She shared that she used to be “disappointed at first when my lines would get cut,” but after a while, she realized that she was blessed for being given a chance to be a part of such a wonderful show. Flannery thanked Greg Daniels,&nbsp;the developer of&nbsp;The Office, for “giving me this job, changing my life, putting me on the map, and making the back of my head almost as famous as the front.”</p><h2>Other shows and movies that Kate Flannery appeared on</h2><p id=par-10_53>Outside of&nbsp;The Office, Flannery acted in other funny shows and movies as well. Fans might recognize her on series such as&nbsp;Wizards of Waverly Place,&nbsp;Brooklyn Nine-Nine, New Girl, American Housewife, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Young Sheldon</a>. Additionally, she competed on Season 28 of&nbsp;Dancing With the Stars. Her partner was Pasha Pashkov, and she ended up in seventh place.</p><p id=par-11_15>Flannery also appeared in movies like&nbsp;Cooties (2014),&nbsp;Slow Learners (2015),&nbsp;4th Man Out (2016), and&nbsp;Fishbowl California (2018).</p><h2>How much is Kate Flannery worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_26>Flannery has taken on a lot of interesting projects over the years. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she has an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p id=par-13_49>Flannery makes much of her money from acting. However, she also makes a bit of money from music as well. Flannery was featured on Jane Lynch’s Christmas album,&nbsp;A Swingin’ Little Christmas. In the 1990’s, Flannery was also a part of a band called Mono Puff that released several albums.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqJ2foZOaeqyt055kn6SRo7umvtisZKedpGLEsL7ToWSappRitbDDjKyfnmWdlrimv4yhnKtlnaS7psWNoaumpF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nurse-jackie-recap-6-15-14-season-6-episode-10-sidecars-and-spermicide.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nurse Jackie Recap 6/15/14: Season 6 Episode 10 Sidecars and Spermicide">&larr;
