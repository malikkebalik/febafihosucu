He has a younger brother named Vishal. Due to his parents' poor financial state, Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali. In 1999, he joined a cricket camp, and at the urging of his coach Dinesh Lad began attending Swami Vivekanand International School to better pursue his cricketing career.</p><h2 id=youth-domestic-first-class-career><strong>Youth and Domestic First-class Career</strong></h2><p>In early 2005, Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone in the Deodhar Trophy. He scored 31 not out as West Zone won. Later, his unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone brought him a new level of attention. In mid-2006, Sharma made his first-class debut for India A in a game against New Zealand A, and scored 57 and 22 as India won. He went on to make his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006-07 season, scoring 205 off 267 balls to help lead Mumbai to victory. Sharma has continued playing for Mumbai in domestic cricket ever since. In late 2009, he notched his highest career score, 309 not out, in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat.</p><h2 id=mumbai-indians><strong>Mumbai Indians</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Sharma joined the IPL's Mumbai Indians. He scored his first and only IPL century in the 2012 tournament, with 109 not out against the Kolkata Knight Riders. However, under his captaincy, the Indians won titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020, tying Sharma with MS Dhoni as the most successful captain in IPL history. Additionally, he is the third-highest run scorer.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-354849 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Rohit-Sharma.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-354849 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Paul Kane/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=international-career><strong>International Career</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Sharma made his full international debut in a one-day match against Ireland in mid-2007. Later in the year, he scored his maiden ODI half-century against Pakistan. Also in 2007, Sharma played for India in the ICC World Twenty20, helping lead the team to victory over Pakistan in the final. In 2010, he scored his maiden ODI century against Zimbabwe, and followed it with another century in the next match against Sri Lanka. Despite suffering a dramatic loss of form in 2012, Sharma bounced back in 2013 to help India win the ICC Champions Trophy. The same year, he made his Test debut against West Indies and scored 177. Sharma continued his success in 2014, breaking the world record for the highest individual score in an ODI match, with 264. The next year, he made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup, playing in eight matches as India fell to Australia. In early 2018, Sharma served as India's team captain for the team's tour to South Africa, and after that led the team to winning the Nidahas Trophy. Later in the year, he led India to victory in the Asia Cup. In 2019, Sharma was named vice captain of India's squad for the Cricket World Cup. In the tournament, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup, and finished as the leading run-scorer. For the tournament, Sharma won the ICC Golden Bat Award.</p><p>In 2021, Sharma enjoyed a successful home series against England, leading India to win the Test by 317 runs. He went on to score his first overseas Test century later in the year, giving him a total of 3,000 runs in Test cricket. For 2021, he was named ICC Men's Test Team of the Year. Sharma had another exceptional year in 2022, when he became the first Indian captain to lead his team to both T20I and ODI series wins in England, and the first captain in T20I history to lead his team to 14 consecutive victories. Moreover, he broke the record for most sixes by an Indian batsman in T20I World Cups, with 34. Sharma went on to have a sensational 2023, breaking <a href=# title="Sachin Tendulkar Net Worth">Sachin Tendulkar</a>'s record for the most World Cup centuries ever, with seven. He also surpassed <a href=# title="Chris Gayle Net Worth">Chris Gayle</a>'s record for most international sixes, and became the first Indian to complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format.
