Unlike other relationships within the cast, their friendship is not that complicated. Instead, it's (mostly) full of entertaining moments. Let's take a look back with a <a href=# class=T3D>timeline of Tom Sandoval and Tom Schwartz's friendship</a>. *Cue the signature Sandoval cry of joy in response to all of the bromantic memories.* Hopefully, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sandoval has another dog to wipe his tears on</a>. If not, Schwartz's shoulder is more than enough to lean on.</p><p>Most of the people on this show go from being friends to enemies — with all variations of frenemy status in between — but not Tom and Tom. They are each other's biggest champions. In fact, it sometimes feels like <a href=# class=T3D>Sandoval's girlfriend Ariana Madix</a> and <a href=# class=T3D>Schwartz's wife Katie Maloney</a> could be the third wheel if either of them is around the pair. They are just that loyal and loving.</p><p>Unfortunately, happy times don't usually make for great television, but that's not the case for Schwartz and Sandoval. Their love fest has blessed the fandom with plenty of iconic quotes and GIFs throughout the years. Everyone should be so lucky to have a friend like either Tom. They've gone through so much while having the best time together, at least for the most part.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Before Bravo: They Met On Craig's List & Became Roomies</h2></p><p>The Toms had a solid friendship before Vanderpump Rules even existed. And <a href=# rel=noreferrer>it all started with a Craig's List advertisement</a>. Sandoval was looking for roommate, Schwartz responded, and eventually they both lived with Jax Taylor, and even Sandoval's then-girlfriend Kristen Doute. Even though they haven't been roomies for a while, they've been best friends ever since.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 3: Schwartz Became A Full-Time Cast Member</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 4, Episode 7: They Failed Their Business Pitch To Lisa</h2></p><p><a href=#>Tom and Tom presented a very vague business pitch</a> for Vanderpump Sangria. It was unclear what they wanted to do, but it involved drinking the product and publicizing it in some way. Needless to say, they did not impress Lisa. It was a rough time, but at least they got through it together.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 4, Episode 9: They Get Butt Tattoos In Las Vegas</h2></p><p>The guys thought they were being sweet boyfriends when <a href=# rel=noreferrer>they got tattoos in honor of their girlfriends</a> during a guys' trip in Las Vegas. However, the butt tattoos weren't the best idea and the whole thing just turned into a big joke. They didn't get approval from Ariana, Katie, or Lisa, but again, at least they had each other.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 4, Episode 10: Sandoval Helps Schwartz Propose To Katie</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 5, Episode 16: Sandoval Gives Up "Tom #1" Title</h2></p><p>Considering these are two guys with the same first name and last names that start with the same letter, things can get a little confusing. Sandoval was "Tom #1," which does make sense since he was the first Tom on the show. However, Sandoval sweetly made Schwartz a "Tom #1 shirt" as a gift and wore a "Tom #2" shirt himself. A peak bromantic moment.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 5, Episode 17: Sandoval Defends Schwartz In New Orleans</h2></p><p>Having a joint bachelor/bachelorette party wasn't the best idea. The cast trip to New Orleans was full of drama. <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Katie, Kristen, and Ariana accused Schwartz of cheating</a> on Katie years prior in Las Vegas. The tension was high and the liquor was flowing. Meanwhile, the guys were dressed in drag. Sandoval was the only one who stood up for Schwartz during a super messy night. And as serious as that moment was, the clip of Snadoval kicking the door open mid-rant was instantly iconic.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 5, Episode 17: Schwartz Shares His Last "Single" Kiss With Sandoval</h2></p><p>The bachelor/bachelorette party wasn't all drama. There was even some Tom on Tom love. The cast played spin the bottle and Sandoval ended up being Schwartz's last (non-Katie) kiss before he got married. How poetic.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 5, Episode 20: Sandoval & Jax Surprise Schwartz With His Brothers</h2></p><p>Sandoval and Jax gave Schwartz the sweetest wedding gift. They paid for<a href=#> his triplet brothers to fly to Schwartz's wedding</a> and they surprised him at the rehearsal dinner. It doesn't get more bromantic than that: best friends and actual brothers all embracing for a big hug.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 5, Episode 21: Sandoval Cried On A Dog At Schwartz's Wedding</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>There wasn't a dry eye in the house (or on the viewers' couches at home) when Schwartz and Katie got married. However, no one had a more memorable cry than <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Sandoval who got so choked up</a> that he wiped his tears on a dog during the ceremony.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 5, Episode 21: Sandoval Gave Tear-Filled Toast About Schwartz</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 5, Episode 21: Lisa Asks Them To Open A Bar</h2></p><p>As if the wedding day wasn't perfect enough, Lisa came through with a life changing offer. Lisa asked Tom and Tom to open a bar with her. That's way better than anything Schwartz had on his wedding registry.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 6, Episode 6: Sandoval Gives The Schwartz Triplets A Makeover</h2></p><p>Even the Toms have an unbreakable bond, Sandoval still has nothing but love for Schwartz's actual siblings. During Season 6, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Sandoval made over the Schwartz triplets</a>. It was about more than some haircuts and outfits. It ended up being a very touching moment between the Toms and the triplets.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 6, Episode 10: They Write Checks To Lisa & Ken</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 6, Episode 13: They Go On Their First Business Trip</h2></p><p>Normally, a Vegas trip includes a lot of debauchery for the Toms. It probably wasn't the best idea for Lisa to invite Schwartz and Sandoval to their first business trip in Sin City. They came up short (and super disheveled) after a night of partying, but thankfully, they made it up to Lisa and Ken eventually.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 7, Episode 8: They Cried Seeing Tom Tom For The First Time</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 7, Episode 9: The Tom Tom 'Daily Mail' Event</h2></p><p>Before the bar officially opened, Sandoval, Schwartz, Lisa, and Ken hosted a big event for Daily Mail at Tom Tom. It ended up being the first Tom Tom storyline that lacked drama. The night was a major success and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Lisa even admitted to being a little tipsy</a> during the celebration.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Season 7, Episode 14: Sandoval Argues With Katie</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>The most recent event in the Tom and Tom friendship timeline is the only one where they were not on the same side. During the March 11 episode of Vanderpump Rules, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Sandoval got into a fight with Katie</a> and accused her of being a "bully" after her talk with Lisa resulted in James Kennedy getting fired from SUR. Not only that, but Katie wanted Sandoval to disinvite James from the cast trip in Mexico. Obviously, this was a very difficult moment for Schwartz. How will they move on?</p><p>The Toms have been through a lot over the years. They have the strongest bond on the show by far, and they'll be able to get through any obstacles that come their way.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jq2fnmWkpLpuv8Cnm6iukaF6tbvMZqqcoKeWv7XGjJ%2Bpop2emcCptc9mq6KllaG2r7GMnq2eqqliw6K6w56pqa2dpXqzwcueqmaekaN6r7HEnapmaWZugXp%2BmGk%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-golden-bachelor-contestant-theresa-nist-s-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is The Golden Bachelor contestant Theresa Nists net worth?">&larr;
