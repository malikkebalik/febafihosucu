His father, a country and western singer, left the family when Owen was three years old, and despite a brief reconciliation when Owen was 19, the two have remained estranged. Raised by his mother and stepfather, a railway ticket clerk, he has described his childhood as "rough". While initially opposed to drama school, he changed his mind in 1984, after a long and fruitless period of searching for work. Owen graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After graduation, he worked at the Young Vic, performing in several Shakespearean plays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmLmqwsRmprCdng%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./davah-lawler-brian-christopher-lawler-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Davah Lawler (Brian Christopher Lawler Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family">&larr;
