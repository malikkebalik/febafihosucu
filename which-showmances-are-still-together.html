The two immediately made a pact, and their showmance began. Unfortunately, they were seen as a threat, and Jeff and Jordan touched the block together during the final five. The houseguests sent Jeff to the jury, and Jordan had the last laugh when she was crowned the winner on finale night.</p><p id=par-3_36>The couple began officially dating after Big Brother 11 concluded, and they returned to play the game as a duo in season 13. Jeff made it to the final seven, and Jordan came in fourth place.</p><p id=par-4_38>Jeff proposed to Jordan during a special episode of Big Brother 16 in 2014, and they married in 2016. The couple has two sons together — one born in October 2016 and the other born in September 2018.</p><h2>Brendon and Rachel</h2><p id=par-5_27>Other than Jeff and Jordan, when Big Brother fans think of showmances, one of the first ones that comes to mind is Rachel Reilly and Brendon Villegas.</p><p id=par-6_53>Rachel and Brendon competed in Big Brother 12 and never tried to hide their showmance. Their relationship made them an obvious target for the other houseguests. However, thanks to a couple of <a href=#>Head of Household wins</a>, Rachel survived until week five. She ultimately came in ninth place, and Brendon came in sixth place.</p><p id=par-7_67>Rachel and Brendon continued their relationship outside the house, and like Jeff and Jordan, they returned as a duo in Big Brother 13. Brendon was evicted during week five, and he battled his way back into the competition just to be taken out again in week seven. On the other hand, Rachel made it to the final two seats and won the game in a 4-3 vote.</p><p id=par-8_20>Rachel and Brendon appeared in The Amazing Race Seasons 20 and 24, where they came in third place both times.</p><p id=par-9_32>Brendon proposed to Rachel in 2011, and the couple married in September 2012.

Daniele and Dominic have two children together — a daughter born in August 2018 and another girl born in November 2021.</p><h2>Cody and Jessica were one of many showmances in ‘Big Brother 19’</h2><p id=par-13_60>Cody Nickson and Jessica Graf began a showmance during Big Brother 19, quickly making them a house target. The players evicted Cody on day 23, but he won a battle-back competition and re-entered the game on day 30. But his and Jessica’s luck wouldn’t last long because Jessica was evicted on day 51, and Cody followed suit the next week.</p><p id=par-14_32>Cody and Jessica were one of many showmances in Big Brother 19, but they are the only couple still together. They competed in The Amazing Race Season 30 together, and they won.</p><p id=par-15_35>In 2018, Cody proposed, and they married in October of that year. <a href=#>Cody and Jessica</a> have three daughters together — one born in March 2019, another in October 2020, and the third in July 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>My baby turned 27.

However, their showmance made them a target, and Swaggy C left after week 2. And due to the domination of the Level Six alliance, the house sent Bayleigh to the jury on day 51.</p><p id=par-17_35>At the finale, Swaggy C proposed to Bayleigh, and she said yes.

These couples met on the show but didn’t kickstart their relationships until after the game ended.</p><p id=par-22_77>Nicole Franzel and Victor Arroyo competed in Big Brother 18 together, and Nicole even pulled off the win. However, she was in a showmance with Corey Brooks during the season, and Victor didn’t vote for her to win. So it was a shock when Nicole and Victor began dating in 2017.
