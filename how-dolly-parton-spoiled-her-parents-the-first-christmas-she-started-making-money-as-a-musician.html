According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Country Thang Daily</a>, this family had humble beginnings, with Parton’s father working as a sharecropper before acquiring his own piece of land to farm tobacco and raise livestock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_42>Of course, after releasing hits like “9 to 5,” “Jolene,” and “I Will Always Love You,” Parton became one of country music’s biggest stars. As a result, the “Hard Candy Christmas” singer gave back to her parents in a pretty unique way.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dolly Parton gave her parents cars for Christmas when she started making money</h2><p id=par-4_47>Although Parton describes her childhood financial situation as “dirt poor,” she often shares that her family had plenty of love for one another. When the artist finally started making money as a musician, she <a href=#>gifted</a> her parents cars for Christmas — her father’s car being especially sentimental.</p><p id=par-5_57>“It was always my wish to do something great for my family,” Parton said during an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a>. “I loved my daddy and my mama. My daddy always drove a truck. I bought my daddy a big blue truck, and he was always so proud of that. He never would trade it in. He kept it.”</p><p id=par-6_41>Even though her father has since died, the artist shared that the truck is still very much a part of her family today. Since taking the truck back, Parton shared that her nieces and nephews spend time playing in the vehicle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dolly Parton inherited her mother’s gold Cadillac, which she named ‘Dolly-Mama’</h2><p id=par-7_40>The same year that Parton bought her father’s truck, Parton purchased a Cadillac for her mother. Every few years she would trade it in, the last one being a gold Cadillac that went back to Parton after her mother died.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_66>“I wouldn’t take nothing for it,” she continued in the same interview. “My husband drives it a lot. Because it was Mama’s car, and I still drive it some, I call it the ‘Dolly-Mama.’ Everybody knows not to mess with the Dolly-Mama because that was such a precious thing. I was always proud that I could do for my family when I started making some money.”</p><p id=par-9_44>There are also several Christmas movies starring Parton with this Grammy Award-winning artist sharing some of her <a href=#>holiday</a> traditions with fans. Parton’s Christmas songs include “Christmas on the Square” and “With Bells On,” both of which are available on most major music streaming platforms.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLjLsmSpmaKpvK950qmmoqSVmXqxrdGepa2rXZu2s7%2FTZpqhqpmowa6t0maqrZmiqbKlecyaoqKml2K6sLrEsmSmraOesKqtzWefraWcZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-carrie-diaries-recap-1-24-14-season-2-episode-12-this-is-the-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Carrie Diaries RECAP 1/24/14: Season 2 Episode 12 This is the Time">&larr;
