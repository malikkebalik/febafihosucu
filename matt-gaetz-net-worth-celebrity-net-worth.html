He was elected to Congress, serving Florida's 1st district, in 2016. He began serving in January 2017.</p><h2 id=financial-disclosures><strong>Financial Disclosures</strong></h2><p>In 2010 Matt reported his net worth to be more than $1 million, although he only earned $29 thousand that year. In 2016, his personal financial disclosure showed Matt had a net worth a little under $500,000. He has not released a financial disclosure since 2016.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Matt Gaetz was born in Hollywood, Florida on May 7, 1982. His mother Vicky worked as a pharmacist for over two decades. His father, <a href=# title="Don Gaetz Net Worth">Don Gaetz</a>, is a former politician and former healthcare executive. Matt's paternal grandfather, Jerry Gaetz, was a North Dakota politician who infamously died of a heart attack live on television at the 1964 Republican National Convention. Matt's father Don was 16 years old at the time and tragically saw his father die live on TV.</p><p>In the early 1980s Don successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Hospice Care Reimbursement Act. This act made hospice costs covered by Medicare. A year after the law was passed, Don and some partners converted what had been a nonprofit hospice care company run by a religious organization into a for-profit entity called VITAS Healthcare.</p><p>In 2004 VITAS was acquired by a company called Chemed for $400 million. Today Chemed generates around $2 billion per year in revenue thanks to its two primary assets: VITAS and Roto Rooter. According to a financial report filed when he was a state Senator, the VITAS sale left Don Gaetz with a net worth of $25 million.</p><p>Matt Gaetz graduated from Florida State University in 2003 then earned his JD from the College of William & Mary.</p><p>After graduating from William & Mary, Matt worked for a law firm in Fort Walton, Beach.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-289160 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Matt-Gaetz.jpg alt="Matt Gaetz" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-289160 class=wp-caption-text>Samuel Corum/Getty Images</p><h2 id=truman-show-house><strong>Truman Show House</strong></h2><p>In 1991, Matt's parents paid $125,000 for a home in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida.

Matt would have been around 15 when filming occurred.</p><p>So Matt Gaetz not only grew up in "The Truman Show" neighborhood, he literally grew up in the Truman's home.</p><p>In the movie the home's address number was 36, which Don and Vicky kept fixed above the front door and keep a sign outside the gate that says "The Truman House".</p><h2 id=political-career><strong>Political Career</strong></h2><p>Matt Gaetz served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 4th district from April 2010 to November 2016.
