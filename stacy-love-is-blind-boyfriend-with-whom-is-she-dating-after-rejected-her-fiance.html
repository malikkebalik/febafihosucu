In the Netflix original series Love is Blind, Stacy famously rejected her fiancé Izzy.</p><p>Fans are interested in finding out who Stacy is dating right now after Izzy and Stacy both verified that they are in new relationships during the most recent reunion episode of the show.</p><h2><strong>Who is Stacy’s Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p><strong>After her time in the pods, it’s unclear who Stacy is dating.</strong> She made a passing reference to an embarrassing encounter she and her new partner had with Izzy and his new girl, but aside from that, she didn’t provide much additional specifics about him or how they appeared to have met.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lauren-Boebert-Divorce-1.jpg><p>We’ll just have to wait and watch whether he appears on her social media for a big revelation. As of yet, there is no information related to Stacy’s boyfriend. When we get any information we will share it with you. Till then you can read other information related to Stacy.</p><h2><strong>What did Stacy Say About Johnie During the Reunion?</strong></h2><p><strong>Stacy and Johnie also got a chance to work out their disagreements during the reunion</strong>, but Stacy went further and posted on social media to explain herself in this post. She said:</p><p>“I have anxiously been waiting in silence to address the context of where my frustration and anger comes from regarding Johnie.”</p><p>You can read her full statement in a post provided below:</p><p><strong>You can check out our below posts related to other stars’ personal life:</strong></p><h2><strong>What Did Izzy Say About Stacy?</strong></h2><p>After the fifth season of Love Is Blind’s filming was over, Izzy Zapata experienced a lot of changes. <strong>He expected to still be with Stacy Snyder even though they did not get married in the end.</strong> But a week after the filming wrapped, his relationship also came to an end.</p><p>Izzy tells:</p><p>“We gave each other a week apart — we’re so mentally and emotionally drained that we felt like it was okay to take the time, We didn’t necessarily establish if we were boyfriend and girlfriend or if we were still engaged, so during that week it was tough for me.”</p><p>“I was going crazy. We would probably exchange a text or two every day as a quick mental health check-in kind of thing. I wanted to do my best to respect her space, but when you’re in love with someone, it’s hard to be away from them, especially in a time like that — that’s where you should be closer together.”</p><p>Izzy insists they never went on a real date, but they did attempt relationships several times. He says:</p><p>“I would go over, we had wine one time and we’ll talk, I stayed the night a couple of times, but we never hooked up or anything. And then I went out with her one time with a couple of her friends to the bar. But I wouldn’t say we even had an official one-on-one date.”</p><p>He and Johnie ultimately decided against getting back together and it was a mutual choice. He says:</p><p>“That was super short-lived, Obviously I shouldn’t have been even dating, I’m still devastated from Stacy, she wasn’t over the fact that I turned her down in the pod, and she was still sad over the Chris scenario too. We just realized that it was not a good time — maybe later on down the road. But then she and I came to see we’re just not each other’s person, we are different people, so that’s why we kept it as just good friends.”</p><p>Izzy doesn’t regret choosing Stacy over Johnie in the pods, regardless of how his time on Love Is Blind turned out. Izzy said:</p><p>“Stacy was the right choice for me, I don’t regret anything through this experience, other than the way I [treated] Johnie at the barbecue.”</p><p>Izzy also disclosed that he had found out that Uche Okorhoa had been disparaging him in the pods during the season 5 reunion. He said:</p><p>“I was hearing from other cast members that he just wasn’t a fan of me, he was thinking I wasn’t a good guy and I was superficial, One time, when me and Stacy reconnected, Uche was actually out with us and a couple of other people having drinks. I walked to the bathroom and as I’m gone, he’s trying to tell Stacy stuff right then and there.”</p><p>Ultimately Uche reached out to Izzy to apologize. He reveals:</p><p>“He was like, ‘I was getting all this stuff fed from Johnie,’ because Johnie was talking bad about me to him, He was like, ‘Now that everything’s playing out, I’m seeing how Johnie really is. I see you are a really good guy, so I just want to apologize for that.’ Now we’re on good terms. No bad blood with anybody.”</p><p>He does, however, prefer that nobody knew about his past financial dealings. He says:</p><p>“It’s not the best, you know what I mean? I think a lot of people can relate and wouldn’t want to just broadcast that out there. But at the end of the day, I don’t regret it because through this entire process, I’ve been open and honest and truly myself. It’s not something that you would obviously want to tell, but at the end of the day, I’m still proud that I told the truth.”</p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> for more information related to other stars’ personal life including their marriage, relationship status, partners and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxzfo6sq5qbqWK5sMLEZqCsZZKhtq%2BwjJumsp6inrKvsI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bd-wong-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="BD Wong Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
