Ronnie Spector was best known as a co-founder and the lead singer of the girl group the Ronettes. In the 60s, the group had such hit songs as "Be My Baby," "(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up," and "Walking in the Rain." Spector also had a solo career as a recording artist with albums including "Siren," "Unfinished Business," and "English Heart."</p><p>In 1968 Ronnie Spector married super producer Phil Spector. Phil was reportedly very abusive, keeping her locked in their house at times. She ultimately left him by breaking through a glass door and walking out, barefoot, since he often hid her shoes so she couldn't leave.</p><p>After struggling to make a comeback throughout the 70s and early 80s, she finally broke through as the featured vocalist on Eddie Money's hit song, "Take Me Home Tonight".</p><p>Unfortunately, Ronnie Spector died on January 12, 2022 at the age of 78.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Ronnie Spector was born as Veronica Yvette Bennett on August 10, 1943 in the East Harlem area of Manhattan in New York City. Her father was Irish, while her mother was black and Cherokee. Bennett grew up with her older sister Estelle in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood. Along with their cousin Nedra Talley, the girls formed a music group called the Darling Sisters. As teens, they performed at local venues while attending George Washington High School.</p><h2 id=ronettes><strong>The Ronettes</strong></h2><p>In the early 60s, the Darling Sisters renamed themselves the Ronettes. Continuing to perform in the greater New York area, they eventually signed to Colpix Records, through which they released a few unsuccessful singles. The Ronettes subsequently signed to Philles Records, the label of record producer <a href=#>Phil Spector</a>. Their relationship with Spector resulted in a string of hit songs throughout the first part of the 60s, starting with 1963's "Be My Baby," which reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This was followed by "Baby, I Love You"; "(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up"; "Do I Love You?"; "Walking in the Rain"; "Born to Be Together"; and "Is This What I Get for Loving You?" The Ronettes had their final charting single, "I Can Hear Music," in 1966. The following year, the group disbanded.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-231726 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ronnie-Spector.jpg alt="Ronnie Spector Net Worth" width=594 height=420 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-231726 class=wp-caption-text>Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>Following her marriage to Phil Spector in the late 60s, Bennett began going by the name Ronnie Spector. She soon launched her solo recording career with her debut single, "Try Some, Buy Some," written by <a href=#>George Harrison</a> and released in 1971. Later, in 1980, Spector released her debut solo studio album, entitled "Siren." She went on to have something of a career resurgence in 1986 when she contributed her vocals to the hit <a href=#>Eddie Money</a> song "Take Me Home Tonight." The year after that, Spector released her second solo album, "Unfinished Business." Her next solo outing didn't come until 1999, when she released the EP "She Talks to Rainbows." In 2003, she released the EP "Something's Gonna Happen," and also contributed backing vocals to a pair of songs on the Misfits' album "Project 1950."</p><p>In 2006, Spector released her third solo studio album, "The Last of the Rock Stars." Four years after that, she released the EP "Ronnie Spector's Best Christmas Ever." This was followed by the 2016 album "English Heart," which contains covers of various songs by British Invasion artists. Among her other notable releases, Spector recorded a cover of <a href=# title="Amy Winehouse Net Worth">Amy Winehouse</a>'s signature song "Back to Black" as an homage to the late singer, who was heavily influenced by Spector.</p><h2 id=relationship-with-phil-spector><strong>Relationship with Phil Spector</strong></h2><p>Soon after signing to Phil Spector's label in 1963, Ronnie began an affair with the record producer, not realizing he was married. Spector eventually divorced his wife in 1965 and began living with Ronnie in Beverly Hills, California. The couple got married in 1968, and subsequently adopted a son named DontÃ© and twin boys named Louis and Gary. Over the ensuing years, Spector subjected Ronnie to all manner of psychological and physical abuses. Early on, he forbade her from performing and restricted her recording output. Ronnie claimed that he had fortified their home with barbed wire and guard dogs and confiscated her shoes so she couldn't leave. Ronnie also said that her husband threatened to kill her and display her corpse in a gold coffin in their basement if she ever left. In 1972, with the assistance of her mother, Ronnie broke through a window in her home and made her escape. She officially divorced Spector in 1974.</p><p>Following her divorce, Spector chose to keep her surname as a means of rebuilding her professional career. Things were made difficult for her, however, as her ex-husband allegedly hired lawyers to keep her from singing and prevent her from receiving royalties. In 1988, Ronnie and the other former Ronettes sued Spector for $10 million in damages, which included nonpayment of royalties and income acquired through the licensing of their music. After languishing without trial for several years, the case was finally adjudicated in 2001 when a New York court ruled in favor of the Ronettes. However, the judgment was overturned the following year by a court of appeals and remanded back to the New York State Supreme Court. Eventually, the outcome resulted in Spector paying over $1 million in royalties to Ronnie.</p><h2 id=later-life-passing><strong>Later Life and Passing</strong></h2><p>In 1982, Spector married Jonathan Greenfield, who was also her manager. The pair had two sons and resided in Danbury, Connecticut. They remained together until Spector's passing in early 2022 at the age of 78.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyzu82noJ5lo6WypMDOq2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-alex-herring-the-woman-with-whom-ned-fulmer-cheated-on-his-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Alex Herring, the woman with whom Ned Fulmer cheated on his wife?">&larr;
