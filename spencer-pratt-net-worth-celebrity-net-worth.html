He became good friends with series star <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a>, (Pratt acted in the role of manager/publicist/agent/stylist for him in the show), and this led to his role on The Hills on MTV.

The feud between the three carried through each season after.</p><p>Pratt was involved in Montag's budding music career in 2007, when he rapped a verse on her single "Body Language" from her debut album and he later directed the music video for her single "Higher."</p><p>In April of 2009, Pratt joined the cast of the reality show I'm A Celebrityâ€¦ Get Me Out Of Here in support of the Feed the Children foundation, on which he was baptized by <a href=#><strong>Stephen Baldwin</strong></a>, along with his wife Heidi Montag whom he had married that same month. Within four days the couple quit the show, saying that NBC had "subjected them to torture." They soon after changed their minds and returned to the show, only to leave shortly after due to Montag's hospitalization because of a gastric ulcer. In 2009, the couple appeared as themselves in an episode of "How I Met Your Mother."&nbsp; In 2010, Pratt and Montag made their last appearance on "The Hills" at the midway point of the sixth and final season.
