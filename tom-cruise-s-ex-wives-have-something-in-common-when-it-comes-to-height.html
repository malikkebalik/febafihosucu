They are all taller than him.</p><p>Published on March 2, 2021</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_82>No one can seem to figure out how tall&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Cruise</a>&nbsp;is, at least officially. While it’s largely accepted that Cruise is 5’7, there are moments when he looks taller or shorter, depending on who he is standing next to. The confusion might have something to do with the open secret that Cruise uses height-enhancing insoles. While Tom Cruise’s height remains something of a mystery, we do know that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his three former wives</a>&nbsp;have one thing in common. Each one has been taller than Cruise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-cruise-s-first-wife-mimi-rogers-was-taller-than-him>Tom Cruise’s first wife, Mimi Rogers, was taller than him</h2><p id=par-2_76>In the 1980s Cruise’s star was on the rise. Still a relative unknown, he kept his private life pretty private. At least, he did until he wed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mimi Rogers</a>&nbsp;in a surprise ceremony in upstate New York. Rogers and Cruise were introduced in 1985 by mutual friends. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Style</a>, they decided to marry quickly, and the couple set out to do so quietly. They got what they wanted, but the marriage was short-lived. They divorced in 1990.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tom-and-Mimi.jpg><p id=par-3_78>Rogers was the first of Cruise’s ex-wife and seemed to be the love interest that set Cruise’s pattern of marrying women taller than him. Roger’s height is reported somewhere between 5’8 and 5’10, with most publications generally accepting that she is about 5’9. In the few public photos of the couple together, she appears shorter than Cruise. Most agree that Rogers wore flats at big events, and Cruise wore lifts to make him look taller than his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicole-kidman-was-the-tallest-of-his-wives>Nicole Kidman was the tallest of his wives</h2><p id=par-4_82>The height difference between Rogers and Cruise was small enough to be almost invisible. That was not the case with his second wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Kidman</a>. Kidman, who is 5’11, often towered over the much shorter Cruise in public photos. The couple met shortly after his divorce from Rogers was finalized. Their relationship moved quickly, and by the end of 1990, they were married. Two years later, they adopted their first child, Isabella Cruise. Their second child, Connor Cruise, joined the family in 1994.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tom-and-Nicole.jpg><p id=par-5_44>The pair announced their split in 2001 and haven’t looked back. Kidman has been married to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Urban</a>&nbsp;since 2008. Cruise has cycled through another marriage since then, too. Kidman and Cruise, despite sharing two children, apparently have had almost no contact in the intervening years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-cruise-s-height-was-called-into-question-when-he-married-katie-holmes>Tom Cruise’s height was called into question when he married Katie Holmes</h2><p id=par-6_66>After his very public divorce from Kidman, he decided to publicly declare his love for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Holmes</a>. Holmes, famed for her role in&nbsp;Dawson’s Creek, was several years Cruise’s junior, but their romance heated up quickly regardless. The pair, who met in April 2005, announced their engagement in June 2005. The couple welcomed their daughter almost exactly one year after they met and were married in November 2006.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tom-and-Katie.jpg><p id=par-7_60>During their very public marriage, fans had a lot of questions about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cruise’s height</a>. Holmes appeared to be much taller than her husband. In actuality, Holmes is 5’9. She seemed so much taller than Cruise because Holmes often wore heels, placing her closer to six feet than her natural height. Holmes and Cruise called it quits on their marriage in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBsLmMnKmuoaOawG6x12auoq6VqHqku8ympqdlmJq2qLTTZ5%2BtpZxk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vanessa-nadal-lin-manuel-miranda-s-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanessa Nadal (Lin-Manuel Miranda's Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; ">&larr;
