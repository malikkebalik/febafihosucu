Despite spending two years working as a correctional officer (a claim he initially denied), Ross was enamored with the lifestyle of drug dealers, naming himself after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drug kingpin “Freeway” Ricky Ross</a>.</p><p id=par-4_33>Freeway apparently wasn’t flattered and sued Ross for $10 million for taking on his persona. After a three-year battle, however, Freeway lost the suit and Ross was able to keep his chosen name.</p><p id=par-5_35>The lawsuit wasn’t the first or last of Ross’ legal trouble. He’s been arrested several times for drug charges, weapon possession, and even assault and kidnapping in 2015. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He served only probation</a> for those charges.</p><p id=par-6_28>Despite his legal troubles and various controversies and feuds, Ross became a successful rapper, thanks in no small part to his persona and his rap lyrics to match.</p><h2>Rick Ross has been nominated for several Grammys</h2><p id=par-7_51>Ross has been busy in his years in the music biz. He has over 10 albums and several Grammy nominations in categories such as Rap Song, R&B Song, and Rap Album. He also regularly does collaborations with the likes of Drake, Jay-Z, Kanye West, and DJ Khaled, to name a few.</p><p id=par-8_49>His most well-known song, the one that skyrocketed him into fame is “Hustlin'” with the recognizable repeated line, “Every day I’m Hustlin’.” It was this song that got the attention of Jay Z and Def Jam Records and lead to official and unofficial remixes with several other famous rappers.</p><p id=par-9_19>Ross’ latest collab is with retired NBA player Dwyane Wade. The single “Season Ticket Holder” is Wade’s rap debut.</p><h2>Rick Ross’ other business ventures</h2><p id=par-10_17>Ross didn’t go on a spending spree when he became famous, and instead, he saved and planned.</p><p id=par-11_45>“My mind may have been on something bigger. I just wasn’t sure, so when you’re not sure, the best thing to always do is just save, just stack, and that’s what I did. I didn’t buy an automobile, I didn’t buy anything,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the rapper said</a>.</p><p id=par-12_48>He had watched his mom invest in real estate and followed in her footsteps. He also began purchasing restaurant franchises. By 2017 he had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased at least 30 Wingstops</a>. He’s a firm believer in empowering his inner circle and his mom and sister run some of his businesses.</p><p id=par-13_24>Ross also owns a Checkers franchises in his home town, has a lot of real estate investments, and his own line of styling products.</p><h2>Rick Ross’ net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_39>In 2015, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes ranked Ross as number 16</a> in their list of the world’s highest-paid hip-hop acts, and put earnings for the year at $9 million. According to the website Celebrity Net Worth, today he’s worth around $40 million.</p><p id=par-15_74>Ross, whose Instagram name is “richforever,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t save and plan forever</a>. He now lives in his lavish mansion in Atlanta, formerly owned by professional boxer Evander Holyfield. The mansion has a large swimming pool, several garages to hold his half a million dollars worth of vintage cars, and over 100 rooms. Some of the rooms include a theater, bowling alley, and arcade, as well as several closets exclusively full of rare and high-priced sneakers.</p><p id=par-16_35>As of his January 2020 interview with Complex, Ross said he’s still learning about the mansion and isn’t sure what his favorite part of it is. He said it could take a lifetime to enjoy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMpqycoF2ewG6%2BwKmnnqpdp7akt4yrpqyrXay8s8DHZ5%2BtpZxk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ronnie-spector-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ronnie Spector Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
