I wrote at the time that “their Instagram post was the typical picture of an amicable Hollywood divorce” and that Tia seemed fine and even happy as she talked about living her truth. Now, their divorce has settled, seemingly rather quickly, and everything continues to be assertively fine. They agreed to split everything with regard to their two kids, Tia’s keeping the house, and also they’re not allowed to introduce new partners to their kids until they’ve been dating exclusively for at least six months.</p><p>‘Sister, Sister’ star Tia Mowry has officially settled her divorce, and will not pay a dime in support to her ex-husband.</p><p>According to new legal documents, obtained by The Blast, Mowry and Cory Hardrict agreed on a simple settlement that will allow each of them to help support their children together on an ongoing basis.</p><p>In the filing, the former couple agreed to share joint legal and physical custody of their two kids. Specifically, the duo will split the costs associated with raising their family — including private school tuition and fees for extracurricular activities.</p><p>Tia Mowry Keeping Family’s Multi-Million Dollar Home In Divorce Settlement</p><p>The famous actress is getting something in this deal that is quite valuable. In the agreement, Mowry will get full ownership of the family’s home in Studio City. It should be noted, that this house is worth $4.3 MILLION. According to Redfin, it “is a 4,871 square foot house on an 8,496 square foot lot with 5 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. This home is currently off the market – it last sold on October 30, 2015, for $2,600,000. In other words, they might quite the profit since buying the home.</p><p>It should be noted, it’s possible Tia paid for the home and is just keeping it in their split.</p><p>In the end, Tia will not pay a dime in child support or spousal support.</p><p>One interesting clause in this agreement has to do with “new romantic partners.” The former couple entered an entire explanation in the agreement for when and how you are allowed to introduce a new person to the kids. Specifically, it states, “Each party is restrained from introducing the minor children to a new romantic partner until the party has been in an exclusive relationship with the romantic partner for at least six months.”</p><p>Famous Ex-Couple Agrees Not To Speak Negatively About Each Other In The Future</p><p>It continues, “Each party is further restrained from permitting his or her new romantic partner from spending overnights with the minor children are with that custodial parent during the first six months of the exclusive relationship.</p><p>Also, Tia and Cory are not allowed to speak negatively about the other one in front of the kids. The agreement spells out this as neither party shall speak “in a negative, disrespectful or derogatory manner to or about the other party in the children’s presence or within hearing distance of the minor children.” Plus, they are forced to make sure other family members and friends comply with this order.</p><p><a href=#>[From Yahoo! Life]</a></p><p>Like that article notes, that clause about dating is interesting, but makes a lot of sense. Not that there necessarily would have been many new partners on either end, but the kids are 11 and 5 and can get easily confused by or attached to new people. Interesting wording about the “exclusive relationship,” because that likely pushes the timeline out a bit longer since often people date around a bit first before choosing one person to date exclusively. The former couple also agreed not to speak negatively about each other in front of their kids and to ensure that their other friends and family don’t either. That’s also a really good clause to get in the agreement, considering even small negative comments can have quite the effect on kids (and adults). And splitting legal and physical custody and all costs for the kids — all of this seems exceedingly, refreshingly reasonable and mature, which is nice to see because divorces often are not. The things I found a bit interesting were Tia keeping the home and not paying any spousal or child support, but maybe Cory just opted out.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/avalon-0541141995.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/avalon-0533321228.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/avalon-0780475460.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos credit: Avalon.red</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWpibYN3e9OimJiln6y%2Fur%2B%2BnaCvp6KYsqCtxqucnqWVo8Ggt8idqpibkaPBoLnEnquYppWsrLGt0a2lnqqjlK%2Bmss6rnJhuj6K8r8DHrJatp5eawamx0Wg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-savitar-in-the-flash-the-god-of-speed-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Savitar in The Flash?
