Maybe?" Gyllenhaal said. "Part of the medicine of storytelling is that we were two straight guys playing these parts. There was a stigma about playing a part like that, you know, why would you do that? And I think it was very important to both of us to break that stigma."</p><p>Gyllenhaal continued: "But then again, I think that has led the way towards people saying, you know, people of all different experiences should be playing more roles, that it shouldn't be limited to a small group of people. And I believe that."</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were both Oscar nominated for their performances in Ang Lee's movie. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Focus Features</span></span></figure><p>"Brokeback Mountain" was one of only a few instances where straight actors had taken on mainstream gay roles, and it became arguably the most successful movie of its kind with eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including best director for Ang Lee.</p><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>The movie was a landmark event for queer cinema</a> and still has a cultural impact to this day and influences many LGBTQ+ filmmakers. Last year, Lee Daniels told Insider that <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>he was actually set to direct the movie.</a></p><p>However, in recent years, attitudes have shifted on straight actors taking on queer roles, with the LGBTQ+ community concerned that straight actors are taking parts from queer actors who may be better suited to the roles.</p><p>Earlier this year, the iconic writer and showrunner Russell T.

Many s<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>traight actors have actually been praised for their performances as queer characters</a> and have gone on to win several awards for doing so.</p><p>Most recently, Ewan McGregor won an Emmy for playing gay fashion designer Roy Halston in Netflix's "Halston."</p><p>McGregor, who is straight, spoke about taking on the role in an interview with <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>The Hollywood Reporter</a>: "If it had been a story about Halston's sexuality more, then maybe it's right that gay actors should play that role. But in this case — and I don't want to sound like I'm worming out of this, because it's something I did think a lot about — I suppose ultimately I felt like it was just one part of who he was."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
