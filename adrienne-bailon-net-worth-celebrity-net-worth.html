Her parents divorced and she was raised in the Lower East Side of Manhattan by her mother and stepfather Joe Felix.

They starred as two of four members of a female girl group named after the film, with Raven-Symone and <a href=# title="Sabrina Bryan Net Worth">Sabrina Bryan</a> portraying the other two members. The film was released in August 2003 and was a ratings hit. The soundtrack for the film debuted at No. 33 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified 2x Platinum.

It brought a total of 8.1 million viewers and was the highest-rated Disney Channel original movie, beating the premiere of the first of the "High School Musical" films. The Cheetah Girls began working on a studio album in January 2006. Meanwhile, 3LW kept working on their fourth studio album "Point of No Return," but it was never released. Bailon and Williams then decided to pursue the Cheetah Girls franchise full time and leave 3LW behind.</p><p>They then set to work on the third film in the Cheetah Girls franchise: "The Cheetah Girls: One World." The film was shot in India and the plot revolved around the Cheetah Girls going to star in a Bollywood production. It premiered to over 7 million viewers.

In 2018, she and her co-hosts won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host for their work. On January 26, 2015, Bailon announced on "The Real" the reason why she had not released her debut solo album at that point. Adrienne claimed that she was "scared to fail" and that she did not like the sound of her own voice because of the fact that executives at Disney praised the fact that she sounded "so young".</p><p>She finally released her debut solo album "New Tradiciones", a Christmas album that featured both English and Spanish songs, on November 17, 2017. In November 2018, Adrienne launched her own jewelry line called XIXI. She also owns a vegan handbag line, La Voute.
