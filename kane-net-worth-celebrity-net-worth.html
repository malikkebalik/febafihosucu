Kane has claimed three world championship titles since joining the promotion in 1995. A central figure in the WWF's "Attitude Era" of the late 1990s and early 2000s, he is known for his hellfire and brimstone stage persona and tag-team partnership with his storyline half-brother <a href=#>the Undertaker</a>. Outside of the ring, Kane has appeared in films, and in 2018 was elected as the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Kane, whose real name is Glenn Thomas Jacobs, was born on April 26, 1967 in TorrejÃ³n de Ardoz, Spain to a United States Air Force family. He grew up near St. Louis, Missouri and attended high school in Bowling Green. For his higher education, Jacobs went to Northeast Missouri State University, from which he graduated with a degree in English literature.</p><h2 id=wrestling-beginnings><strong>Wrestling Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Jacobs began his career as a professional wrestler in 1992 on the independent circuit. Using the name Angus King, he wrestled for the Central States Wrestling Association in Missouri. Jacobs also appeared with the Tennessee-based United States Wrestling Association as an evil Christmas character. In 1993, he made a one-off appearance with World Championship Wrestling under the name Bruiser Mastino. Jacobs subsequently moved to Tampa, Florida, where he wrestled as Sid Powers with the International Championship Wrestling Alliance. After that stint, he returned to the USWA and wrestled as Doomsday. Using his real name, Jacobs wrestled in Japan for Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi in late 1993 and early 1994. In the latter year, he appeared with the Tri-State Wrestling and Championship Wrestling promotions; wrestled with the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico; and appeared with the Catch Wrestling Association in Germany.</p><p>In early 1995, Jacobs was hired to join <a href=# title="Jim Cornette Net Worth">Jim Cornette</a>'s Tennessee-based promotion Smoky Mountain Wrestling.

Going by Mike Unabomb, he defeated Reno Riggins in a dark match. Jacobs went on to make his first WWF television appearance under the name Isaac Yankem. After wrestling as Yankem for a while, he became Diesel and formed a tag team with Rick Bognar as Razor Ramon. In 1997, Jacobs debuted his most famous and longest-running character: Kane, a horror-themed fire juggernaut and younger half-brother of the Undertaker. The two characters were engaged in a vicious feud early on, culminating in Kane's victory over the Undertaker on "Raw is War." At the subsequent King of the Ring event, Kane defeated Stone Cold <a href=# title="Steve Austin Net Worth">Steve Austin</a> to win the WWF Championship. However, he lost the title the following night back to Austin.</p><p>In 1998, Kane formed a tag team with Mankind; together, they won two WWF Tag Team Championships. Kane eventually turned on Mankind and allied with the Undertaker, forming the tag team the Brothers of Destruction. He soon formed another tag team, with X-Pac, and gained a girlfriend, Tori. With X-Pac, Kane won two more WWF Tag Team Championships. However, the two soon entered into a feud, which lasted until WrestleMania 2000. Back with the Undertaker as the Brothers of Destruction, Kane got into feuds with Edge and Christian, Rikishi and Haku, and the Two-Man Power Trip. The Brothers of Destruction also feuded with Page and Kanyon, whom they defeated to win both the WWF and WCW Tag Team Championships. Among his other big wins, Kane defeated <a href=# title="Triple H Net Worth">Triple H</a> at Judgment Day to win the Intercontinental Championship.</p><h2 id=further-wwf-wwe-career><strong>Further WWF/WWE Career</strong></h2><p>After the WWF was divided into the "Raw" and "SmackDown!" brands in 2002, Kane joined "Raw." The WWF shortly thereafter became WWE. On "Raw" in September, Kane won the WWE Tag Team Championship with the Hurricane. The following month, he began a feud with Triple H. After the end of that feud, Kane formed a tag team with <a href=# title="Rob Van Dam Net Worth">Rob Van Dam</a> and won another World Tag Team Championship. In 2004, Kane began a turbulent romance with Lita. He feuded with many other wrestlers over the subsequent years, including Edge, Umaga, Montel Vontavious Porter, King Booker, the Blue Bloods, Finlay, and Big Daddy V. In 2008, Kane won the ECW Championship, prompting him to join the ECW brand.</p><p>In 2010, Kane achieved a major feat when he won the World Heavyweight Championship, making him the first WWE wrestler ever to win the WWE, ECW, and World Heavyweight Championships.

A couple years later, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-346432 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kane-1.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1588px) 100vw, 1588px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-346432 class=wp-caption-text>(MANAN VATSYAYANA/AFP via Getty Images)</p><p>Beyond the ring, Kane has acted in some films.
