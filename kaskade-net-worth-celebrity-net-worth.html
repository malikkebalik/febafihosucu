I don't drink, I don't smoke. I'm a bit of a freak that way because I'm completely different from what you would think. Look, you can't put all electronic musicians or DJs or whatever you want to call us in one pot. A lot of these guys live in the night and party, but with me, I'm married and have three children. I have a life outside of this."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Kaskade has earned seven Grammy nominations: Best Dance/Electronica Album for "Fire & Ice" (2013) and "Atmosphere" (2014), Best Dance Recording for "Atmosphere" (2014), Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for "Smile (Kaskade Edit)" (2015), and Best Remixed Recording for "Runaway (U & I) (Kaskade Remix)" (2016), "Only (Kaskade x Lipless Remix)" (2017), and "Stargazing (Kaskade Remix)" (2019).
