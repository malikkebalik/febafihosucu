Kramer alleged that Stoller's book "Maybe We'll Have You Back: The Life of a Perennial TV Guest Star" alleged that he was homophobic, based on a passage about Stoller taking Kramer's NYC bus tour. Fred wrote about the tour going to Greenwich Village to revisit the 1993 episode "The Outing," which is about a journalist thinking Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza are gay and famously includes the line "Not that there's anything wrong with that." Stoller wrote, "In the gay-dominated Greenwich Village, I had to hear [Kramer's tour guide] make everyone scream out, 'Not that there's anything wrong with that!'" Fred added that the guide seemed like "some sort of deranged cheerleader." A judge dismissed the case in July 2014, and Stoller told "L.A. Weekly" shortly after, "My book is a lighthearted memoir. The court victory is one of those bittersweet things. Obviously this shouldn't have happened. I never wrote something to get anyone or be mean. I just wanted to tell my story and be humorous and connect to people."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>in 2012, Stoller won a Festival Prize for Best Actor for "Fred & Vinnie" at the London Greek Film Festival. In 2015, the "Over the Garden Wall" cast earned two Behind the Voice Actors Award nominations for Best Vocal Ensemble in a New Television Series, winning the BTVA People's Choice Voice Acting Award. Their other nomination was for the BTVA Television Voice Acting Award.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqku8yem6KZnqh8p77EnWSsrJ%2Bhuaa%2BjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-mel-tucker-still-married-to-his-wife-jo-ellyn-tucker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Mel Tucker Still Married to His Wife Jo-Ellyn Tucker?">&larr;
