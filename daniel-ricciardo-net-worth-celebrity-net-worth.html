Earnhardt was driving a No. 3 car when he died in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500. Ricciardo told "USA Today Sports" in 2014, "I was a big fan of Dale Earnhardt. I'm a fan of motorsports, but I've followed NASCAR since I was very young. It was my first go-kart number, as well. When Formula One said you can pick your numbers this year, it was a no-brainer for me to choose the 3." Daniel is a fan of the Australian Football League team the West Coast Eagles, and in 2015 and 2016, he was their #1 ticket holder. He is also a fan of the UFC and the NFL team the Buffalo Bills.
