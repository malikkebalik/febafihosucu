However, as many of the band’s loyal fans already know, <a href=#>Black Eyed Peas</a> began much before then.&nbsp;Before Black Eyed Peas there was Atban Klann. When will.i.am and apl.de.ap were in high school, they both were a part of a breakdancing crew known as Tribal Nation. However, the pair’s close connection and collaborations led the two to branch out. They began exploring music, and that was when the rappers created Atban Klann.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_92>Atban Klann had success pretty early on. Eazy-E, a popular and influential rapper of the time, took an interest in Atban Klann and signed the group in 1992. However, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All Music</a> has detailed, many people didn’t understand will.i.am and apl.de.ap’s unique sound, and when Eazy-E tragically died in 1995, the group realized they were going to have to quite literally regroup.&nbsp;Atban Klann decided to recruit Taboo, another talented rapper and performer, and Kim Hill, a powerhouse vocalist, and with the group’s newest addition, they reintroduced the band as Black Eyed Peas.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-group-has-gone-through-changes-over-the-years>The group has gone through changes over the years</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/bep/status/1375901044274823168</p></figure><p id=par-4_76>The Black Eyed Peas’ journey has been a successful but long one. Over the years the band has gained a lot of fans and followers, but some people may be curious about the official members of the talented band.&nbsp;Will.i.am and apl.de.ap are the two visionaries behind Black Eyed Peas, and both artists are still active members of the group. Taboo, an LA native, joined the group in 1995 and has been going strong ever since.</p><p id=par-5_62>Around the same time was when Kim Hill was welcomed on board, but the vocalist eventually made the decision to step down in 2000. When the band was looking to fill the vocal spot they found what seemed to be just the perfect fit: Fergie.&nbsp;In 2002 Fergie officially joined Black Eyed Peas and the band’s success and fame skyrocketed almost instantly.</p><p id=par-6_67>Her impressive vocals, stylish looks, and authentic attitude made her a hit across the board. With the help of Fergie, the band was able to produce some of their most memorable hits like “Where is the Love?” and “I Gotta Feeling.”&nbsp;Fergie has since stepped away from the band to focus on parenting and being a mom, but Black Eyed Peas has continued to produce and release music.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-which-member-of-the-black-eyed-peas-has-the-highest-net-worth>Which member of the Black Eyed Peas has the highest net worth?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-7_49>The Black Eyed Peas have come a long way. Their countless record-breaking hits and awards are a testimony to that. However, some of the band’s fans may be wondering which member of Black Eyed Peas has the highest net worth. Fortunately, Celebrity Net Worth has all of the details.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_63>As for Hill’s net worth is estimated at just $1 million. Looking at Taboo, his net worth is estimated to be an impressive $15 million dollars, and his band member apl.de.ap isn’t too far off from Taboo with an estimated net worth of $20 million dollars.&nbsp;Though she has taken a bit of a hiatus, Fergie’s net worth comes in at $45 million.</p><p id=par-9_43>However, will.i.am comes out on top with a net worth of $70 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Though all of the present and former members of Black Eyed Peas have a lot of success, will.i.am definitely seems to be in the lead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbXCoWSmnZ2XsrN5zp9km6SRmLhusdiem2aolZbAbrTArGStoJVitaqzx56qrWWemsFuw86rq6FmmKm6rXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aaron-watson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Watson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
