He was in a pretty serious relationship with Kourtney Kardashian. So serious that the two were together for damn near a decade and even have three children together. While the two may not be dating now, they’ve strived to create an excellent relationship and knock their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>co-parenting duties</a> out of the park.</p><p id=par-3_46>In fact, Disick made regular appearances on the family’s show up until last year despite already being in another relationship with the lovely <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Sofia Richie.</a>&nbsp;But who exactly is Disick and what does he do for a living outside of cameo appearances on&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Scott Disick?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/scott-disick-income.jpg><p id=par-4_83>A native New Yorker, Disick comes from a wealthy family. His grandfather made it big as a Wall Street Attorney before shifting gears to real estate development. David Disick, the slick patriarch, basically pulled all the right strings enabling his grandson to live a more than a cushy lifestyle. But somewhere between his affluent high school days and the present, the Disicks ran into some money troubles. Evident by Jeffrey Disick, Scott’s dad, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>trying to steal money</a> from his employer — a bank.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Scott Disick makes appearances on ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’</h2><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_77>When the news about Scott Disick’s dad stealing came out, it caused a massive uproar in the Kardashian-Jenner clan. At the time, the only thing the thieve’s son had going for him was that he was a reality star. One that gained his visibility thanks to his exposure on&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians. To make matters worse, he wasn’t nailing his beau duties with Kardashian at all, often living beyond his means and ogling at other women.</p><p id=par-6_54>Even so, the TV personality was making a whopping <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>$500,000 each episode.</a> He’s appeared in at least 137 episodes between 2007 and 2018. You do the math. Bankrolling such high paychecks, it’s no surprise that Disick has amassed himself a net worth of approximately $20 million. That’s just $10 million less than Kendall Jenner!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What else does Scott Disick do for a living?</h2><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_72>Disick makes a pretty penny on&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians, but that isn’t his only source of income. He’s so well-known that he can charge thousands of dollars for just dropping into clubs and partying it up for a few hours.&nbsp;GQ reported that in his heyday, he was making upwards of $80,000 an appearance. That’s nothing compared to what he makes on&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians,&nbsp;but it is for far less work!</p><p id=par-8_84>Disick has also been paid for appearing on other shows. In 2013, he was the star of a web series called&nbsp;Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord&nbsp;which gave fans an insider look at his lavish lifestyle. Sure, the web series is in the past, but Disick has a new project on his plate —&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Flip It Like Disick</a>. The series, with its HGTV vibe, will follow him as he buys and sells luxury homes. Talk about a great way to invest those&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&nbsp;paychecks.&nbsp;</p><p>“Fans of Scott on&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&nbsp;will get to see another side of him in&nbsp;Flip It Like Disick, as an entrepreneur and design guru, leading his talented and opinionated team through difficult design challenges that result in astonishing reveals.” –&nbsp;Executive Vice President of Development and Production Amy Introcaso-David</p><p id=par-9_40>&nbsp;It looks like Disick is making the move from reality star to real estate mogul. A move that will no doubt help him gain credibility that he could’ve only dreamed of having while starring solely on&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZpuonaNiwKS7061knaGjnrCsecOoZJ%2BnomKubrjIr6Cnn16dwa64jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-killed-derek-shepherd-why-the-attending-responsible-for-mcdreamy-s-death-returned.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Killed Derek Shepherd?
